## 🚀 Work Done So Far

✅ Created GitHub repository  
✅ Set up initial project folder structure  
✅ Configured `.gitignore` (ignores venv, caches, OS files)  
✅ Added **Netflix Titles dataset** (`csv` and `xlsx`)  
✅ Synced project to GitHub on the `main` branch

## ⚙️ Next Steps

- Add detailed README with project goals and progress  
- Create first Jupyter notebook for **initial data exploration (EDA)**  
- Track dependencies in `requirements.txt`  
- Prepare for dashboards and Streamlit app

## 📌 Notes

- Dataset is small enough to be tracked in GitHub  
- `.gitignore` was updated so `data/raw/` is included  
- Repo is now ready for notebooks and further work
